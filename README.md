# Balancing Equity and Bonds
*A tool to explore how to diversify a leveraged portfolio, as described by Clifford S. Asness*

## Introduction
I recently spent some time exploring the topic of balancing equity and bonds. I spent most of my time looking at two particular publications: *College and University Endowment Funds: Why Not 100% Equities?* by Richard H. Thaler and J. Peter Williamson, and *Why **Not** 100% Equities* by Clifford S. Asness. In evaluating both positions, I agreed more with Asness's analysis: firstly, that crafting a set of efficient portfolios with varying risks is a separate part of developing a portfolio than actually deciding which portfolio to choose (i.e. what risk/return ratio to assume). Secondly, that a 60:40 ratio of equities to bonds, levered to match the same volatility, is the better option, matching risk according to standard deviation while outperforming the other portfolio in compound return. Additionally, Asness makes a compelling argument that the 60:40 portfolio is superior in both the worst cases and in the probability of outperformance. 

## Query
Asness then continues his analysis by looking at when you cannot or will not lever, or if you have a long time horizon, and brings up a sidenote regarding equilibrium. While these are certainly interesting, I was more interested in exploring the numerical side of his analysis through three main data-driven lenses: annualized total returns, worst case analysis, and probability of outperformance. Asness's analysis brought up one major question for me. What is the optimal ratio of equities to bonds? The paper was written in 1996, and in reading it almost 30 years, I had access to computational tools that were not present back then. So, I developed this tool to weigh a levered portfolio with varying ratios against the 100% stocks portfolio using similar analytical methods.
